Although importing itself is pretty straightforward, creating an optimized import strategy needs a bit of planning on your end. Hence, before we start with this guide, there are a few things to keep in mind.

0. When importing, you want to make sure that you max out all the CPUs available. It's more often than not the case that the import script is the bottleneck.
    0. Tip, use `htop` when importing to see if all CPUs are maxed out.
    0. Learn more about how to plan your setup [here](./installation.html#running-weaviate-yourself).
0. Use¬†[parallelization](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/parallelization.htm#:~:text=Parallelization%20is%20the%20act%20of,the%20next%2C%20then%20the%20next.); if the CPUs are not maxed out, just add another import process.
0. For Kubernetes, fewer large machines are faster than more small machines. Just because of network latency.

## Importing

First of all, some rules of thumb.

* In almost all cases, you want to batch import data.
* As mentioned above, max out your CPUs (on the Weaviate cluster). Often your import script is the bottleneck.
* Process error messages.
* Some clients (especially Python) have some build-in logic to efficiently regulate batch importing.

Assuming that you've read the [schema getting started guide](./schema.html), you import data based on the classes and properties defined in the schema (no üí©, üïµÔ∏è). The big difference between [importing a single object](#importing-single-data-objects) in Weaviate and batch importing is that instead of sending a single JSON object, you import an array of JSON objects.

As you've seen in the [basics getting started guide](./basics.html#data-objects-in-weaviate), Weaviate data objects are class/property based JSON-objects.

An example of a single object:

```json
{
    "id": "32d5a368-ace8-3bb7-ade7-9f7ff03eddb6",
    "class": "Publication",
    "properties": {
        "name": "The New York Times"
    },
    "vector": [
        -0.0030892247,
        0.17440806,
        0.024489688
    ]
}
```

An example of an array of data objects:

```json
[{
    "id": "32d5a368-ace8-3bb7-ade7-9f7ff03eddb6",
    "class": "Publication",
    "properties": {
        "name": "The New York Times"
    },
    "vector": [
        -0.0030892247,
        0.17440806,
        0.024489688
    ]
}, {
    "class": "Author",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Paul Krugman",
        "age": 69,
        "born": "1953-02-28T00:00:00.0Z",
        "wonNobelPrize": true,
        "description": "Paul Robin Krugman is an American economist [...] New Economic Geography."
    },
    "vector": [
        -0.16147631,
        -0.065765485,
        -0.06546908
    ]
}]
```

Let's import the data (make sure you have [an empty Weaviate running](./installation.html)) and use Weaviate's [auto schema feature](./schema.html#auto-schema-feature) to generate a schema.

```python
import weaviate

def check_batch_result(results: dict):
    """
    Check batch results for errors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : dict
        The Weaviate batch creation return value, i.e. returned value of the client.batch.create_objects().
    """

    if results is not None:
        for result in results:
            if 'result' in result and 'errors' in result['result']:
                if 'error' in result['result']['errors']:
                    print(result['result']['errors']['error'])

client = weaviate.Client("https://some-endpoint.semi.network/") # <== if you use the WCS
# or
client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080") # <== if you use Docker-compose

# delete all classes
client.schema.delete_all()

# create the batch array
batch_obj_array = [{
    "id": "32d5a368-ace8-3bb7-ade7-9f7ff03eddb6",
    "class": "Publication",
    "properties": {
        "name": "The New York Times"
    },
    "vector": [
        -0.0030892247,
        0.17440806,
        0.024489688
    ]
}, {
    "id": "f564113e-11e2-11ed-861d-0242ac120002",
    "class": "Author",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Paul Krugman",
        "age": 69,
        "born": "1953-02-28T00:00:00.0Z",
        "wonNobelPrize": true,
        "description": "Paul Robin Krugman is an American economist [...] New Economic Geography."
    },
    "vector": [
        -0.16147631,
        -0.065765485,
        -0.06546908
    ]
}]

# import the batch
for obj in batch_obj_array:
    with client.batch(callback=check_batch_result) as batch:
        # Add object with a custom vector
        batch.add_data_object(obj['properties'], obj['class'], obj['id'], vector=obj['vector'])
```

You can now see the added object here:

```python
import weaviate
import json

client = weaviate.Client("https://some-endpoint.semi.network/") # <== if you use the WCS
# or
client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080") # <== if you use Docker-compose

all_objects = client.data_object.get()
print(json.dumps(all_objects))
```
